## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Java JDK** (version 21 or higher) ☕
- **Node.js & npm** 🟢
- **Appium Server** 🚀
- **Android Studio** (with emulator/device setup) 🤖
- **Maven** 📦

### 💾 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omarelbably/AppiumAutomationDemo.git
    cd AppiumAutomationDemo
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    - Using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```
3. **Start Appium Server:**
    - Install Appium:
        ```bash
        npm install -g appium
        ```
    - Run Appium:
        ```bash
        appium
        ```

### 📝 Configuration

- Update device and platform details in `src/main/resources/config.properties` or relevant config files.
- Specify Android capabilities (device name, platform version, app path, etc.) as needed for your local or CI environment.

## ▶️ Running Tests

- **Using Maven:**
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

---

## 🧩 Component Usage

### 📝 Test Scripts (`src/test/java/tests/`)
Contains all automated test cases, organized by feature or module. Test scripts interact with page objects and utilize utility classes.

### 📄 Page Objects (`src/main/java/pages/`)
Implements the Page Object Model for representing individual screens and user flows within your Android app.

### 🛎️ Utilities (`src/main/java/utils/`)
Reusable helper classes for driver management, logging, configuration handling, and more.

---

## 🔌 Extending the Framework

- **Add New Test Cases:** Place new test classes under `src/test/java/tests/`. 📝
- **Add New Page Objects:** Create new page classes in `src/main/java/pages/`. 📄
- **Enhance Utilities:** Extend or add helper methods in `src/main/java/utils/`. 🛎️
- **Reporting:** Configure additional reporting options in your build file or reporting utility. 📊

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting & FAQs

- **Appium server not running:** Ensure Appium is installed and started before test execution. 🚀
- **Android device not detected:** Verify device/emulator connection and update capability configuration. 🤖
- **Build issues:** Check Java, Node.js, and dependency versions for compatibility. ☕🟢
